### Fact Sheet

University Theater (UT) is both one of the most active Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) in the University, and is co-curricular with the Theater and Performance Studies academic department. Annually, the co-curricular program involves over 500 members of the University of Chicago community, produces upward of 30 different shows, and entertains 10,000 audience members. Our academic program offers studio theater courses taught by some of Chicago’s most talented and experienced theater professionals.


### A Brief History

University Theater (UT) builds on a strong tradition of student-run theater at the University of Chicago that began in 1898. The administrative structure that currently governs UT was created in 1986, when various performing arts RSOs on campus combined under the University Theater header. Off-Off Campus, UT’s improvisational comedy troupe, was founded in 1986. The Dean’s Men, dedicated to performing Shakespeare plays during the theater seasons, was founded in 2006 and joined with University Theater in 2010.
