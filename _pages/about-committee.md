UT Committee is the governing body and public face of University Theater. As elected representatives, Committee is responsible for fostering, approving, scheduling and supporting student productions. They relate the needs and concerns of the UT community to TAPS Pro Staff and the Center for Leadership and Involvement, ensuring the stability and continuity of theater and performance on campus. Committee members write and propose new bylaws, striving to accurately reflect the current needs of the community as well as their vision for how UT might change and grow. Often, this work is done in “Sub-Committees,” or, smaller groups of Committee members dedicated to specific initiatives. As of very recently, some Sub-Committees may be open to community members who have a strong interest in working with Committee on an initiative!

Every Committee is made up of ten elected members, as well as one representative from Off-Off Campus, Tech Staff, Student Staff, and the Dean's Men. They meet every Monday at 5pm, 1st-9th week of every quarter! Each meeting begins with a Public Portion, where members of the community are encouraged to participate, say hi, and share their thoughts. Make sure to stop by! Want to learn more?
