Welcome to University Theater! We're delighted you're thinking of auditioning for a UT production. Here's some info on auditions and what to expect from them!

Our auditions are not meant to be stressful or intimidating, and all casting teams are rooting for you to do your best. The most important thing is to have fun!

#### When and where are auditions?

General auditions happen Tuesday and Wednesday evening, 7-10pm, of 1st Week of Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarters in Cobb Hall.

For Fall 2021, auditions will be on September 28 and 29, with callbacks on the evening of September 30.


#### What should I do to prepare?

There'll be basic instructions for each show's audition posted on this page in the near future! There'll also be an audition form you can fill out ahead of time; however, you can also do this at auditions if you wish. 

Otherwise, **you can come as you are**! If you would like to prepare more thoroughly, you can find the audition materials for each show posted on the UT website. However, you are **never** expected to memorize any material before an audition with UT. 


#### What should I do when I get to auditions?

If you haven't filled out your audition form ahead of time, you should do that before signing up to audition, either on your own device or one that UT Committee provides. 

Then, each show auditioning will have a separate table when you can go to sign up for a 5-10 minute audition slot. Audition materials you can take will be available at these tables.

When it's your time to audition, you'll be called by the management teams at each table who will let you into the audition room.  


#### Who can I ask for help at auditions?

UT Committee will have a table set up near the front of the hallway where we are happy to answer all your questions! The management teams at each show's table will also be happy to help.


#### What will I be asked to do in the audition room?

This will vary a little from show to show, but usually you will be asked to read a short monologue excerpt from the script. There will be sides posted ahead of the audition on the site, and you simply pick one to read! Note it **does not** have to be memorized.  

If you're auditioning for a musical, you'll probably be asked to sing from a posted side or a song of your choosing, and there may be an exercise to test your vocal range as well.

You will often be given a "redirect" after your initial reading, where the casting team will ask you to read again following a small piece of direction, or you may be asked to read a different side, which you'll be provided. 


#### Are there callbacks? How do I know if I got one?

If you are called back, it means the directing team wants to see more of you! Callbacks are Thursday night in Cobb Hall after general auditions.

Actors who auditioned will get an email with materials and a callback schedule, usually in late Wednesday evening or early Thursday morning after general auditions.

Casting teams may not always send emails to those who did not get a callback, but not getting a callback doesn't mean you aren't being cast! Everyone should check the final cast list, which will be emailed to them on Friday.


#### What can I expect at callbacks?
Callbacks can be whatever the directing team wants and often varies. You could read scenes with other people, do acting/movement exercises, sing or play music, etc. You will be told in your scheduling email what you'll be expected to read and do.


#### How will I know if I'm cast?
Cast lists will be emailed to auditionees and may be posted outside of the TAPS Lounge at the Logan Center on Friday of 1st Week around early afternoon. Auditionees are expected to check this list and confirm their role with stage management by the end of Friday, so be on the lookout then!

#### Can I be cast in more than one show?

Generally not. All directors of UT shows and workshops arbitrate casting in a closed meeting with the Director of Performance Programs to make sure actors only get cast in one show per quarter.
