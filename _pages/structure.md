Students, staff, faculty, and alumni work together within University Theater to support the program and provide as many theater opportunities as possible. Students primarily drive the program. Members of the University community propose shows to produce, as well as staff, direct, and act in these shows.

### UT Committee

An elected body of students known as UT Committee serves as artistic directors and producers of University Theater’s seasons, and select from the proposals which shows will appear on UT stages. (For more detailed information on UT Committee’s members, duties, and responsibilities, see Section I.A.2.)

### Pro-staff

University Theater/Theater and Performance Studies Professional Staff (UT/TAPS Pro-staff) further offer artistic and technical advice and support to members of UT, maintain the equipment and spaces, and provide administrative support. Pro-staff is joined by part-time Student Staff members. Full job descriptions of Pro-staff and Student Staff can be found on the [Theater and Performance website](http://taps.uchicago.edu).

### Teaching Lab Collaborations (TLC)

Teaching Lab Collaborations (TLC) is the outreach wing of the TAPS department. Dedicated to creating meaningful, challenging, and fun programming for Hyde Park’s youngest artists, TLC offers classes led by professional teaching artists and apprenticed by University of Chicago students throughout the year.

UT is dedicated to producing a wide variety of shows, including but not limited to traditional theater, musicals, opera, and dance shows, all while keeping University Theater’s Mission Statement at the heart of all decisions.
