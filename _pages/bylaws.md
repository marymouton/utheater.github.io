## University Theater's Mission Statement

University Theater provides students with the opportunity to have artistic control of every production aspect of shows presented under the UT banner. University Theater enables members of the University community to explore and practice the many aspects of theater.

UT has three main goals that guide its decision making.

*    **Opportunity:** To provide opportunities for members of the University of Chicago community to present and to experience theater.
*   **Education:** To improve the work we do and to learn from successes and mistakes. Peer mentorship and collaboration with TAPS as a co-curricular program are both means through which we strive to learn and teach. Students need not be a TAPS major to participate in UT, or vice versa.
*   **Artistic Excellence:** To support the artistic achievements in student work.

### General Membership Guidelines

Though membership of UT consists almost entirely of students, the organization is open to all members of the University: students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

Membership shall be open to all UChicago Students and must comply with the University of Chicago’s guidelines non-discrimination statement.

To be eligible to be a voting member of UT (i.e., to vote on members of Committee) members must have either
*    at least 1 credit in the past 4 quarters - credits include participation in any mainstage play or workshop, and a credit is counted if it is in process the quarter that a vote is taken (that is, a first-time member of any show is eligible to vote the quarter that they participate and all quarters following).
*    Regularly attended one or more production cohorts for a full year

### Hazing

University Theatre will abide by the University of Chicago’s Hazing Policy.

### Governing Bodies

University Theater is governed by the UT Student Committee and advised and supported by UT/TAPS Professional Staff (Pro-Staff). Additionally, Off-Off Campus and the Dean's Men report to UT committee in the form of a liaison; each organization has its own set of governing guidelines. UT Student Committee also will appoint a liaison to Theater [24], another of its subsidiaries. The by-laws for each of UT’s bodies (UT, Dean’s Men,Off-Off Campus, and Theater [24]) follow.

## I. The University Theater Committee

### A. Duties and Responsibilities
  1. As the governing body of University Theater, the UT Committee represents the UT community’s interests to the UT/TAPS Professional Staff and to the University at large. The students on Committee maintain artistic control of University Theater, scheduling its productions and encouraging the creative development of the community.
  2. Individual Committee members should be committed to the overall improvement of the organization and its ability to provide opportunities to those who participate in theater at the University of Chicago. Although elected members often play important roles in other aspects of UT and its productions, they must remain committed first and foremost to fulfilling their duties as Committee members. These duties and responsibilities include but are not limited to:
      * Representing the UT community;
      * Publicly supporting both the Committee’s decisions and the theater projects of every member of the UT community;
      * Allowing ample time for regular weekly Committee meetings (5pm every Monday), quarterly proposal meetings, and other special meetings called as necessary;
      * Voting on seasons University Theater will produce and determining the scheduling of Dean’s Men and University Theater shows (UT Committee neither passes nor schedules shows for Off-Off Campus);
      * Offering suggestions to Pro-staff concerning policy and day-to-day operation;
      * Electing its officers;
      * Preparing Programming Coordinating Council (PCC) budget requests;
      * make every human effort to assist with general maintenance and clean-up of UT facilities, attending quarterly Project Days, etc.;
      * Maintaining a positive public persona, including talking to prospective and incoming/new students at University-sponsored RSO events;
      * Being available for advice and guidance when other community members need assistance;
      * Serving as Committee Liaisons to all UT shows (this includes Mainstages, Workshops, Dean’s Men, Theater [24], and Collaborations);
      * Training and orienting their replacements at the end of their tenure;
      * In a neutral, positive manner and setting, promoting Committee elections and encouraging students to run and vote;
      * Make every human effort to see all UT productions, including at least one Off Off show per quarter and one Theater [24] festival per year;
      * Distributing the “University Theater Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Resource Sheet” and “Recommended Process for Complaint Escalation” to productions.p. Attending annual Title IX training in the Spring to be led by the Phoenix Survivors Alliance (PSA). The Chair will reach out to the Co-Presidents of PSA in order to arrange a time, place, and workshop leader (See Section I.B.4.a.i).

  3. The Committee Liaison is responsible for ensuring the safety of all members in a production and acts as a communication point between a production and Committee during the show’s production process and performances. A Committee Liaison can only be responsible for one production per quarter. The responsibilities of a Committee Liaison include the following:
      * Reaching out to and meeting with the production’s director, stage manager, and production manager before the first rehearsal to establish expectations around how the Committee Liaison will interact with the production process.
      * Giving a brief presentation on Chicago Theater Standards before the end of the second week of production to both the cast and crew. This presentation should also highlight the roles of Cast/Staff NEDs and University Theater’s Conflict Resolution Path.
      * Scheduling and attending check-ins with the Cast/Staff NEDs at least once every two weeks after the first rehearsal.
      * Attending production meetings every week, at least one rehearsal once every two weeks, and every rehearsal during the last week of the production. They should also make every human effort to attend rehearsals involving fight and intimacy choreography, as well as strike.
      * Documenting any outstanding concerns, especially safety issues that pose an immediate threat to the members of the production, during production meetings and rehearsals discovered either through observation or communication with a member of the production. The concerns should be relayed to the show’s management, Committee, and/or TAPS Professional Staff if relevant.
      * Assisting with the mediation of conflicts and complaints between members of the production whenever necessary. Unless anonymity is explicitly waived, the identities of all those involved must be anonymous.
      * Implementing and facilitating the distribution of an online production feedback form that is available throughout the entire production process. The cast and crew should be regularly reminded of its presence and how to access it. The form must have an option which maintains the anonymity of the submission.
      * Coordinating with the production’s director and management to create weekly updates on the state of the show and any issues that have occurred in the time since the last update. This update will be presented to Committee at its next meeting, and should attempt to be informative to the extent that any Committee member can take over for the liaison with enough knowledge of the production’s dynamics, history, and ongoing concerns.
      * Should the Committee Liaison be unable to make a scheduled commitment detailed in (a), (b), (c), and/or (d), they should reach out to another Committee member as soon as possible so that the Committee member can represent the Committee Liaison at said commitment. The Committee Liaison must give the Committee member any extra information about the production that is required to properly fulfill the responsibilities of a Committee Liaison.

### B. Membership, Meetings and Voting

1.  #### Composition
    UT Committee consists of student voting members and non-voting UT/TAPS Professional Staff. The student members are elected annually from the UT community, and consist of:

      *       1 Dean's Men representative, nominated by the Dean's Men
      *       1 Off-Off Campus representative, nominated by Off-Off
      *       1 representative from Student Administrative Staff
      *       1 representative from Student Technical Staff

2.  #### Elections
    Students on the Committee serve one-year terms. Elections for general members are held Seventh Week of Winter Quarter. Elections for representatives from the Dean’s Men, Off-Off, Student Staff, and Tech Staff are held according to the schedules determined in the bylaws of those organizations. Vacancies at other times will be filled by Special Elections. At least two weeks in advance of the election, a notice shall be posted to the UT general list-host (utheater-general@lists.uchicago.edu).
      * ##### Eligibility
      To run for Committee, a candidate must be either:
        * a registered student with TWO (2) University Theater cast or production staff credits within the FOUR (4) quarters prior to the election, including the quarter of the election and excluding any quarters spent studying abroad; or,
        * a member of Off-Off Campus in their second quarter of training.
        * a curator of Theater [24] for three (3) quarters within the last five (5) quarters prior to the election, including the quarter of the election and excluding quarters spent abroad.

        Candidates must also be prepared to be available for the 5pm Monday meeting time for the entirety of their potential term. Collaboration credits do not count as University Theater credits.

        To vote in Committee elections, community members must be either:
          * a registered student with ONE (1) University Theater cast or production staff credit within the FOUR (4) quarters prior to the election, including the quarter of the election and excluding any quarters spent studying abroad; or,
          * a member of Off-Off Campus at least in their second quarter of training. Members of Pro-staff may not vote in the elections for Committee. Collaboration credits do not count as University Theater credits.
      * ##### Nomination
        Candidates must provide one-page statement listing their past UT involvement and motivation for running for Committee. This statement must be submitted to the sitting Committee Chair by 5PM the Friday before the election. A list of the candidates and their statements must be emailed to the UT General Listhost that evening. A ballot shall be prepared listing every candidate. If necessary, the Committee Chair will verify the eligibility of candidates and voters.
      * ##### The Election Meeting
        If the sitting Committee Chair is not running in the election, he or she shall chair the election meeting. Otherwise, a member of Pro-staff shall chair. No rehearsals or other UT events may be scheduled at the same time as the election meeting. Each candidate will be given one minute to make a statement followed by a question-and-answer session, lasting not more than two minutes per candidate. Personal endorsements are not allowed. Finally, each voter may cast a number of votes up to the number of vacancies on the Committee. All votes, absentee or otherwise, must be turned in fifteen minutes after the election meeting. The votes shall be tabulated by members of Pro-staff and the results will be posted to the UT general listhost immediately following the elections. Vote totals will remain confidential. Two- or three-way ties will result in the election of all the tying candidates to Committee. Any larger ties, if they bring the number of elected non-staff student Committee members above 10 (as in Section I.B.1), are arbitrated by coin toss.
      * ##### Special Elections
        Should the number of elected, non-staff student Committee members (including general members, Off-Off rep, and Dean’s Men rep) drop below ten (10) at any point, special elections will be held at the next possible committee meeting. An email will be sent out within twenty-four (24) hours of the resignation or removal of the previous committee member asking for statements, as per the general election requirements. These statements must be received before the meeting in which the election will take place. Sitting members of the committee then vote to fill the seats up for election from amongst the candidates. Eligibility for special elections is the same as for general elections, and the number of seats up for elections will be limited to those vacant (i.e., until the number of non-staff student Committee members is restored to ten).
3.  #### Removal of Committee Members
    The Committee may remove a member by a two-thirds majority in the following instances:
      *   The Committee member in question submits a letter of resignation to the Chair of the Committee.
      *   The Committee member in question ceases to be a registered student at the University of Chicago.
      *   The Committee member does not meet the standards outlined in I.A.2. or has proved ineffective in their other duties, especially as a Committee Liaison to a UT production.


    The motion for the removal of a Committee member may be made by another Committee member or by a community member lodging a formal grievance to the UT Committee, and must be included in the next meeting's Agenda.

4.  #### Committee Officers
    * ##### Position Descriptions
      * ###### Chair
        Sets weekly meeting agenda. Runs all Committee meetings. Serves as a voting member of the University of Chicago Program Coordinating Council (PCC) and as a liaison with the Center for Leadership and Involvement (CLI). Sits on the Logan Center Student Advisory Committee and the Performing Arts Roundtable. Coordinates annual Title IX trainings with PSA (See Section I.A.2.q).
      * ###### Secretary
        Takes minutes at all Committee meetings, sends the draft to the Committee for approval within 24 hours, and sends the approved minutes to the general listhost after an additional 24 hours. (For most information on the protocol for the minutes, see Section I.B.5.b.) Also records any changes to the by-laws after each Committee meeting, keeping a regularly updated copy and noting the changes in the public Committee minutes. After the final committee meeting of each quarter, emails the most recent edition of the bylaws to the UT general listhost. Actively maintains the “University Theater Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Resource Sheet,” updating information, noting changes in public Committee minutes, and posting the most current version of these documents in the UT Lounge.
      * ###### Social Chair
        The Social Chair shall primarily be responsible for helping and encouraging Committee to foster a sense of community within UT. They will reach out to the appropriate leadership of the Dean’s Men and Off-Off Campus to coordinate ways to ensure that UT remains cohesive as an organization. The Social Chair will be responsible for any social events put forward by Committee, and they are expected to facilitate at least one event per quarter.
      * ###### Other Positions
        Further officer positions may be created by each new Committee to serve its own needs and those of the community. Frequently such positions include liaisons to organizations outside the Performing Arts Roundtable, such as FOTA.
    * ##### Terms of Office and Eligibility
      Officers' terms are from the time of election through the end of the following winter quarter. If an officer needs to be replaced prior to this time, a special officer election shall be held at a regular Committee meeting. Officers can be replaced by a two-thirds majority vote of the Committee. In the case of absences, each officer may designate another Committee member to fulfill their duties. Student Staff Committee members (Student Administrative and Technical Staff) are ineligible for Committee Officer positions.
    * ##### Election of Officers
      New officers are nominated and elected during the Tenth Week Committee meeting of Winter Quarter by the newly elected voting Committee members who will begin serving in the Spring Quarter. Position descriptions shall be provided to the new Committee by the outgoing Committee at the end of the Winter Quarter. After brief presentations by those who are running, the Committee shall vote by secret ballot. The individual who receives a majority vote of those present shall fill the position.
    * ##### Filling Vacant Offices
      If at any time an office is vacated through the removal or resignation of a committee member, the duties and responsibilities of that office (but not the office itself) may be taken on in the interim by another member or divided up among members of the Committee. This is done by a nomination or motion during the meeting at which the vacancy occurs or is discovered, and is approved by majority vote. After the number of elected committee members is restored to TEN (10) through special elections (see Section I.B.2.d), a special officer election will be held for the vacant offices, to be held until the end of the winner's Committee term. Committee members already holding an office are permitted to run for vacant offices, but if elected must give up their previous office, which will then be filled by special election within that same meeting.
5. #### Meetings
    * ##### Frequency
      The Committee meets regularly, once a week during the regular school term (Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters). Meetings are at 5pm on Monday evening. Any member of the Committee may ask the Chair of the Committee to call a special meeting, at which point a phone or email poll of the other members will determine if quorum can be reached, at which point a meeting is held. Regular Committee meetings should be scheduled for at least one hour with a reasonable amount of time set aside for accidentals, incidentals, and unforeseen important business. Committee members should not schedule rehearsals, builds, etc. that conflict with the already-scheduled Committee meetings. Members who wish to have item put on the agenda should contact the Chair of the Committee at least 24 hours before the meeting.
    * ##### Agendas and Minutes
      The agenda for the meeting should be emailed to the Committee 24 hours before the meeting. Minutes of the meeting should be posted to the UT Committee Executive Session listhost by the Secretary within 24 hours of the end of the meeting. These minutes must clearly demarcate Executive Session (closed meeting) minutes from for-public minutes. Committee has an additional 24 hours after this point to suggest any changes in information, wording, or regarding the demarcation, or to make further additions. After this period, the Secretary posts the minutes, with Executive Session minutes removed, to the UT general listhost. Any changes to by-laws occurring in a Committee meeting must be noted in the public minutes.
    * ##### Attendance and Quorum
      Committee meetings, with the exception of the Mainstage Proposal Meeting and open forums, are closed ('Executive Session'). Quorum for a regular meeting is a majority of voting members. For a proposal meeting, at least four of those members must be elected, non-staff student members.
    * ##### Voting
      General issues are voted on by 'secret ballot,’ either on paper or by secret show of hands. A member of UT/TAPS Pro-staff tallies the votes. At any point during a Committee meeting, a Committee member can request the issue at hand be put to a vote. While individual votes are secret, vote totals may be published in the notes.
    * ##### Open Session
      Meetings are in open session starting at 5pm during this time any member of the UT community is welcome to join the meetings. This open session moves to executive session during which time meeting guests can no longer sit in on the meeting unless a member of committee invites them and committee votes to allow it. In addition to this chance to join a meeting, any member of the community can request a place on the agenda before the meeting to bring up issues, concerns or questions. This can be done by contacting the Committee Chair or any other member of Committee prior to said meeting.

### C. Committee Policies
  1.  #### Grievances
      In the event that a community member or members, or Committee member or members, feel that a member or members of Committee have acted inappropriately (i.e., does not fulfill the responsibilities as outlined in Section I.A.2), they may propose the issue to the Committee Chair within 24 hours of the meeting. In such circumstances, each side should be allowed to make its case. Committee members directly involved in the complaint will then be excused while the remainder of Committee determines a response in an Executive Session. If the Committee determines that the Committee member or members have acted inappropriately, formal responses can range from censure (i.e. a public statement in the minutes) to removal from the Committee.
  2.  #### Fairness
      If a community or Committee member or members are concerned about a Committee member's ability to vote fairly during a proposal meeting or regular meeting, the Chair should ask publicly or privately that the individual or individuals in question consider their fairness. If the situation has not changed, any member of the Committee may ask for a vote on the person's further participation in the process, which can include removal from vote or discussion. Should the Committee Member choose to remove themself from the vote, they may have the opportunity to state so at the beginning of the proposal meeting. If the Chair is an individual in question, the Director of UT/TAPS should be approached.
  3.  #### Budgeting and Financial Matters
      All Mainstage productions (8th and 10th week productions) have a budget between $2000 and $3000. All Second Stage productions (6th week productions)have a budget between $500 and $1500. All Dean’s Men productions have a budget between $1000 and $2000. Weekends of Workshops, site specific proposals, and Studio productions have a budget between $0 and $250. The budget of individual productions within these ranges will be determined following the process outlined in VI.A. The only budget that may be extended beyond this is that of the Spring quarter 10th week mainstage, and only under the circumstances described in VI.A.1.D.I and by the processes described in IV.A.c.ii.
  4.  #### Amending the By-Laws
      These by-laws can be amended by a two-thirds vote of the entire Committee. After each meeting, any amendments to the by-laws must be made in the Secretary’s running copy of the by-laws and noted by the Secretary in the public committee meeting minutes. After the final (10th Week) meeting of each quarter, the Secretary emails the most recent edition of the bylaws to the UT general listhost if there have been changes that quarter.
        * Any proposal deliberated on by committee must be decided and enacted under the bylaws that existed when it was proposed. Once a decision has been reached, committee will not hold another vote on the matter unless new information arises. A change of the bylaws is not considered new information for the purposes of reconsidering a decided matter. This item of the by-laws may only be changed by a unanimous vote of committee.
        * Any amendments to the by-laws must be proposed and added to the committee agenda at least twenty-four hours in advance of any meeting in which they can be passed.
        * Any amendments to the by-laws which are not deemed urgently necessary by the Chair must be shared with the community for feedback at least 48 hours before the amendment can be voted on. The author(s) shall not be identified when the by-law is shared unless they request to be identified. Amendments can subsequently be modified and voted on based on the feedback received without being shared again.

### D. Diversity, Representation, and Inclusion Statement

University Theater is committed to fostering diversity in its community and in its productions. University Theater does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national or ethnic origin, age, status as an individual with a disability, protected veteran status, genetic information, or other protected groups under the law (see the University of Chicago's Non-Discrimination Statement and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972).

If one or more of the protected groups listed above are integral to a character's identity per the playwright's text and/or the directorial team's vision, then directorial teams should cast an actor that represents the protected group(s) through the actor’s own identities. If none of the protected groups listed above are integral to a character's identity per the playwright's text and/or the directorial team's vision, then directorial teams should be mindful that such factors of an actor's appearance and/or identity do not negatively impact in any way an actor's chances of being cast in the role.

In addition, University Theater values and invites storytelling that showcases, celebrates, and/or uplifts all identities. As such, when conceiving of production visions, members are encouraged to consider “identity-conscious” approaches (rather than “identity-blind” approaches)—that is, explicitly and intentionally leveraging identity in casting, crew, and production work with the aim of increasing awareness, honoring culture, fostering equity, and/or promoting identity and identity-focused discourse.

These approaches may include (and are not limited to):
  1. Intentionally assembling diverse casts and crews to increase representation and encourage many different voices in the rehearsal room, the production room, and on stage.
  2. Being attentive to casting and stage pictures that depict or are reminiscent of historically discriminatory viewpoints and consciously avoiding such depictions unless they are crucial to the playwright's text and/or the directorial team's vision.
  3. Selecting theater pieces for performance that are written by and/or present the perspectives of under-represented/minority groups.
  4. Consciously casting people who identify as a member of one or more protected groups—where there may not be precedent to do so—in roles that serve to uniquely portray, uplift, or present the perspectives of their protected group(s).
  5. Consciously employing a staff of directors, designers, managers, and/or assistants who identify as members of one or more protected groups to uniquely portray, uplift, or present the perspectives of their protected group(s) in all aspects of production—not just in acting.
  6. Actively engaging with organizations on campus and/or in the larger community that have relevant missions related to diversity, inclusion, and/or promoting awareness of different identities both while conceiving of production visions and throughout the rehearsal process.

## II. The Dean's Men

  * ### Purpose

      Founded in 2006, The Dean's Men is a student organization at the University of Chicago dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. Through University Theater productions and other activities, we strive to bring the Bard's writing to the school and create a community of theater makers in the process. We are dedicated to this community, which prospers through social events as well as the rehearsal process. We believe in the importance of its warm, joyous existence. As we continue to cultivate and strengthen our art, so we continue to cultivate and strengthen our community. Once a Dean's Man, always a Dean's Man.

      In addition to our quarterly University Theater show, we take part in community outreach, engage with academic resources, and participate in other artist and social endeavors. In the past, such endeavors have included directing a yearly Shakespeare show with local middle school students at St. Thomas Academy, organizing bi-weekly play readings, and hosting gatherings with David Bevington, the world-renowned Shakespeare scholar.

  * ### Production Process

      The Dean’s Men will perform three shows per year. Once a director and show have been selected for a particular quarter, the Board will assist the director in filling a staff and finding a space, as need be. The selected Dean’s Men show is then submitted to University Theater so that a space and week may be selected with sensitivity to the UT season (see below). The Dean’s Men productions, as UT productions, will fully participate in UT production requirements such as arbitration and space scheduling.

      If a show passes the Dean’s Men voting process during Fall or Winter Quarter, this production automatically goes into the Fall or Winter Quarter UT schedules. After a show has passed, a space request will be submitted for the Francis X. Kinahan (FXK) Theater. If the passed director/proposer opts to propose for a different UT space, Committee may consider this option during the scheduling portion of the quarterly Committee Proposal Meeting. No pro/con or other merit-based discussion of the proposed production will occur in the Committee Proposal Meeting once the show has been passed in the Dean’s Men voting process. If the FXK theater or other desired space is not available, the Dean’s Men will consult Pro-Staff for alternate locations.

      The same above holds true for the Spring Quarter production, substituting Logan Courtyard for the FXK. Upholding long-standing University of Chicago tradition, The Dean’s Men will do everything in their power to make this Spring Quarter production an outdoors production, even if it is held in an outdoor location other than Logan Courtyard. Should an excellent case be made in a proposal for an inside Spring show, however, the Dean’s Men may vote for it in their proposal voting process. Should this decision affect space rental fees and therefore budgets, The Dean’s Men will meet with Pro-Staff and Committee prior to the Committee Proposal Meeting to discuss alternate locations and determine the best course of action on a case by case basis.

      The Dean’s Men will be allocated a design budget for each production by Pro-Staff in accordance with the UT budgeting process. All box-office proceeds from Dean’s Men shows will be considered UT profit and treated as such. The spring show is traditionally free and will not have box-office proceeds.

      During show weekend, the Production Manager will serve as House Manager and cooperate with the UT Front of House Manager assigned to the performance. Board members are subject to ushering duties as needed.

  * ### Dean's Men Activities and University Theater
      The Dean’s Men retain the right to perform sonnets, collections of scenes, etc. throughout the school year and summer as opportunities arise and as they see fit. The Dean’s Men understand that when they engage in these opportunities they are representing the Shakespeare face of University Theater and will act accordingly.

  * ### Artistic Autonomy

      The Dean’s Men Board retains the right to give respectful input and feedback for Dean’s Men shows as the occasion arises. However, directors for Dean’s Men shows maintain complete artistic autonomy. Directors and designers may make whatever choices they deem fit and use available resources to support their vision for the show, provided that they cause neither emotional nor physical harm. Barring extreme circumstances, individuals working on a Dean’s Men show as a director, designer, actor, or assistant may not accept another position on the same show (e.g. a director may not also be a designer or actor, and the reverse is true).

  * ### Membership

      Consistent with the inclusive motto of the organization – “Once a Dean’s Man, always a Dean’s Man” – the Dean’s Men membership consists of all individuals who have a show credit on a Dean’s Men production. Show credits include directors, head designers, production managers, stage managers, actors, assistants, and other positions (including board ops and stage hands) at the discretion of the production manager and director.

  * ### Voting Procedure

    All voting held by the Dean’s Men (e.g. show proposals and board elections) will be decided by majority vote whenever possible. The voting process is to be conducted as follows:

      1. All voters will be asked to rank all of the possible candidates on their ballots in their order of preference.
      2. The Board will count all of the first-choice votes for each candidate. If any
      candidate receives a majority (that is, over 50%) of the votes, then that candidate automatically wins.
      3. If no candidate receives a majority, then all votes cast for the candidate with the _fewest_ votes will be redistributed to the second-choice candidate listed on each ballot. If any candidate has a majority at this point, then that candidate automatically wins.
      4. This process is repeated (eliminating the ballots cast for the candidate with the fewest votes and redistributing them to the highest-ranked choice that has not yet been eliminated) until one candidate receives a majority vote.

    If all but two candidates have been eliminated via this process and the result is a tie, then the procedure for Board Elections is as follows: The most recent round of runoffs is undone and the candidate with the most votes wins.

    In the event of a tie in proposals, the procedure is as follows: There is a discussion and re-vote with the two tied candidates, and the candidate with the most votes wins. If a tie occurs once again between these two proposals, the Board will vote. If there is a tie within the Board vote, then a coin will be flipped to determine the show.
  * {:.fake-letter-i} invis
  * ### Board Elections

    The Board is elected by Voting Members of the organization (as defined in Section 5) at an annual meeting specifically designated as the Board Election Meeting. Said meeting will take place midway through Spring Quarter. Voting takes place for Board positions in the order stated above, starting with the President. Positions may be added, subtracted, and/or altered in response to current organization conditions and requirements as the present Board deems fit.

    An email will be sent out well in advance of the Board Election Meeting calling for people to run for Board positions. To be eligible to run for a Dean’s Men Board position, a Voting Member of the organization must send in a statement of intent, including all of the positions they intend to run for. At the Board Election meeting, each candidate will present a brief statement and participate in a two minute question and answer session. Time will be kept by the Treasurer. Once all candidates complete their two minute question and answer session, all Voting Members will cast their votes by secret ballot. A majority vote is needed to elect a candidate (see Section 8 for our voting procedure). The current President and Secretary will announce the results at that time. Then voting for the following positions will go through the same process.

    Dean’s Men members who are not able to attend the Board Election meeting may vote for the representatives of their choice in absentia via email and/or Google Doc, to be managed by the Secretary. These absent voters are expected to read the statements of intents submitted by alldirectors prior to submitting their vote to the Secretary.

In the event of a midterm vacancy, the relevant Chair will nominate a replacement. The Board will then be responsible for approving that nominee.
  * ### Show Proposals
    Any member of the University Community is welcome to propose to direct for the Dean’s Men. Any show may be proposed with the exception of King Lear. All proposals will consist of filling out the proposal form created by the Board. Alterations to this form may be made as necessary to reflect changing values by the Board. Directors do not need staff or sketches to accompany their proposals. However, directors are requested to propose with a space and time in mind, as well as conceptions of their designs for the show. Proposal forms must be submitted by the announced deadline during the Quarter prior to the production. Proposals shall be submitted via email to the Board ([board.shakespeare@lists.uchicago.edu](mailto:board.shakespeare@lists.uchicago.edu)) and in the form of two hardcopies in the Board’s mailbox. At that time, proposers should email the Board listhost with the names of at least three Board members with whom they would like to meet to discuss their proposals.
  * ### Selection of Proposals
    The Board will determine a meeting time to select a proposal. The Dean’s Men autonomous voting meeting will always occur a week prior to the Committee Proposal Meeting, so that Dean’s Men proposers may propose for other UT spaces than the FXK or Logan Courtyard. The Board will announce the meeting time and distribute copies of proposals to all interested Dean’s Men. Before the proposal meeting proper, all proposers must meet with at least three Board members to discuss their proposals.

    At the proposal meeting, proposers will take turns speaking for five minutes about their proposals without any other proposers in the room. They will then take part in a question and answer session, and answer clarifying questions for eight minutes from Voting Members of the Dean’s Men. The Treasurer will keep time. All relevant parties are welcome to come to the proposal meeting and hear the general statements, however, only Voting Members of the Dean’s Men may stay for the question and answer sessions.

    Following each question and answer session, directors are asked to leave the room. Once all directors have been questioned, the remaining Voting Members of the Dean’s Men will discuss the proposals and vote by secret ballot. For voting procedure, see Section 8. Dean’s Men members who are not able to attend the proposal meeting may vote for a show of their choice in absentia via email and/or Google Doc, to be managed by the Secretary. These absent voters areexpected to read the proposal documents submitted by all directors prior to submitting their vote to the Secretary. They are required to provide at least one show credit for proof of voting, as well as a valid excuse (such as work, illness, class, study abroad, etc.) for their absence.
  * ### Non-Production Activities
    The Dean’s Men may hold non-production related activities outside of the UT Mainstage season. These activities may include but are not limited to publicity events, fundraisers, staged readings, discussion groups, and short performances.
  * ### Amendments
    At any time, the Board of the Dean’s Men reserves the right to amend or change our bylaws as required by changes in circumstance, opinion, or values. All changes to the bylaws must reach majority vote by the Board and then require ratification by University Theater Committee.

    ## III. Off-Off Campus

    Off-Off Campus, University Theater’s improvisational comedy troupe, was founded in 1986 by Frank Kinahan, Bernie Sahlins, Steve Schroer, and a number of students. Each Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarter, Off-Off Campus performs a new comedy revue consisting of five Friday night shows (4th through 8th Week) at the Blue Gargoyle Theater in University Church. The Revues consist of original sketches and long and short form improvisation, directed, written, and performed by the members of Off-Off Campus. Off-Off also performs a summer season (length and dates vary) in the Logan Center for the Arts, and performs a variety of special shows including the “O-Week Show” in Mandel Hall.

    Like any other UT Mainstage show, the costs associated with the production are covered by ticket sales. And, like any other UT show any profit made is used for the benefit of the entire organization; this includes upkeep of spaces, general publicity, props, competition fees, etc. However, unlike any other UT Mainstage show, the UT Committee does not control Off-Off-Campus' schedule.

    Herein, Off-Off Campus may be referred to as "Off-Off" or "OOC" for brevity's sake.

      * ### Membership, Business Meetings, and Voting
        1. #### Membership
            *   ##### Membership Status

The 1st Generation was cast in 1986, the 2nd in 1987, etc. No member may change Generations. Off-Off Membership is brokeninto two categories: Active Members and Alumni.

                    * _Active Members_. All collegiate members of Off-Off Campus are given Active Status. A generation and its members has active status for four consecutive years. If a member graduates or leaves the College prior to their Generation completing those four years, then that member’s status changes from Active to Alumni.


                    * _Alumni_. All graduated members of Off-Off Campus, or members of Off-Off Campus whose generations have graduated, are given Alumni status. Alumni are welcome to come back and perform/ direct at the discretion of the current active members.

                * The Performing Generation performs 2 Consecutive Revues (Spring and Fall), selects their directors, is the creative face of Off-Off for the duration of their time as the Performing Generation. The Performing Generation has first priority for any extra performances and other opportunities that arise during their tenure as Performing Generation, provided they do not conflict with the Revue rehearsal and performance schedule.

                  * The Winter Quarter trainer(s) may direct the new generation in three afterglows during the winter quarter (traditionally one sketch, one improvisation, and one of both/either). However, they can also elect to have other members of OOC direct some of all of these afterglows

        2. #### Directing
            * ##### Directors of Spring and Fall Revues
                * The Spring and Fall Revues will consist of 5 shows, to take place 4<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> week of the academic quarter. The performers are exclusively the members of the current Performing Generation.
                * _Selection_. The director(s) will be elected by the performing generation at the final business meeting of the previous quarter (Winter Quarter for the Spring Revue, Spring Quarter for the Fall Revue). Any current or former member of OOC can make a proposal to direct the Mainstage production, unless they are in the performing generation. Two members may propose to direct together on one proposal, but two proposals cannot be chosen. In their proposal, the potential directors should lay out their vision for the season as well as practical details such as rehearsal schedules. After presentations, the performing generation will be left to deliberate. A simple majority selects the director(s) except in cases where only one person is being considered.  If only one person is being considered they are automatically given the position of Director. Elections will be run by OOC's Production Manager with the APM stepping in if the Production Manager is being considered for the position of Director.
                * The director(s) will be responsible for setting a rehearsal schedule, obtaining any necessary resources for the shows, and running the lights and sound for the shows.
                * The director(s) must be prop trained before the first show of the season.
            * ##### Directors of Winter Shows
                * During Winter Quarter, five intergenerational shows will be performed 4<sup>th</sup> through 8<sup>th</sup> week of the academic quarter.
                * The new generation is ineligible for participation in the Winter Revue.
                * _Selection_. The directors for Winter Shows will be elected by all current members of OOC at the designated business meeting of the Fall Quarter. Any current or former member of OOC can make a proposal to direct one of the five shows, unless they are in training.
                * _Proposals_. The Winter Show Proposal should contain the following information: the name(s) of the director(s) the nature of the show they want to direct, how many performers they are planning to cast, if they intend to participate in the show as well as direct, and how often they will hold rehearsals, and an itemized/ projected budget for the show. After presentations, the five shows will be selected by secret ballot.  Each voting member can list up to five shows on their ballot. The five shows with the most votes become the winter season. Ties will be decided by runoff election.  In the event that five or fewer shows are proposed, all pass automatically.
                * Elections will be run by OOC's Production Manager with the APM stepping in if the Production Manager is being considered for the position of Director.
                * Directly following the vote, passed proposers will submit week preferences to the PM, who will schedule the season.
                * The directors will be responsible for setting a rehearsal schedule, obtaining any necessary resources for the shows, and running the lights and sound for the shows.
                * The director(s) must be prop trained prior to the week of their show.

      * ### Pre- and Afterglows, and Other Performances
          1. #### Pre and Afterglows
              * Preglows are 15-30 minute performances by campus music, theater, or dance groups that precede Main Stage shows.
              * Afterglows are 30-60 minute performances by campus music, theater, or dance groups that follow Main Stage shows.
              * OOC members have first priority to schedule pre or afterglows. The final afterglow of Fall Quarter, as well as three winter quarter afterglows, must be reserved for the training generation for showcases.
              * The APM is responsible for all scheduling and management of Pre and Afterglows
          2. #### Competitions and Outside Projects
              * Active members are encouraged to seek out comedy competitions and outside projects.
              * Communication with the PM is required, but any team under any director may compete after training is complete. Preference is given to the individual(s) who sought out the competition, and/or the most recent performing generation.
          3. #### The O-Week Show
              * During Orientation Week, Off-Off will perform a free sketch show in Mandel Hall in collaboration with ORCSA.
              * The O Week Show Director will be elected at the Spring Quarter Business Meeting.
              * Any active member of Off-Off can participate in the O-Week show.

## II. Theater [24]
  * ### Purpose
      Since at least 2009, Theater[24] is a quarterly theater festival of new work that is written, directed, rehearsed, and designed by University of Chicago students within 24 hours. It traditionally occurs on the first week of each quarter, although it can occasionally be postponed to second week due to religious holidays or other conflicting events. Theater[24] is a zany and hectic experience for anyone who wants to get involved with theater at the University of Chicago, but doesn’t want to commit more than 24 hours to it!
  * ### Production Process / What Theater[24] Curators Do
      * 9<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> week of the quarter before: Curators meet to decide the theme of this quarter’s Theater[24]. The theme serves as a prompt for the writers and as a way to connect all the plays together into a cohesive one-night festival. Curators then create a sign-up form for the festival. The sign-up form should ask for:

          * Name
          * Pronouns
          * Year
          * Email and phone number
          * Roommate’s email and phone number
          * A ranking of the positions they would most like in the festival: Writer, Actor, Designer, Director
          * What other quarters they have participated in the festival
          * IF THEY CHOSE WRITER: Who would they like to write with? Would they be willing to write with a stranger?
          * Why they want to be involved in this quarter's festival and why they chose the positions you did.
          * A creative writing prompt (usually related to the theme in some way).

        Curators should also start reaching out to Chicago theater professionals for a dramaturg. A dramaturg is a Chicago theater professional (not a currently enrolled UChicago undergraduate student) who stays with the writers throughout the night, offering writing tips, dramaturgical advice, and emotional support, while the curators are asleep.

        {:.ul-lower-roman}
          * They are paid $300 by TAPS for working between the hours of 8:30pm and 8am Friday night of the festival.
          * Dramaturgs are reached out to, and selected by, the Theater[24] Curator team at least a week in advance of the quarter’s festival. Upon dramaturg selection, curators will reach out to Neel with the dramaturg’s email such that payment and official forms can be completed.
      * Over O-Week/Winter Break/Spring Break: Curators send out the sign-up form for the festival to the University Theater and Theater[24] listhosts. The form should be completed by a Wednesday 1 st week 9pm deadline.
      * Wednesday 1<sup>st</sup> week 9pm or later: Curators meet to read the form responses. This is an anonymous process, requiring one of the curators to replace names with numbers for the sake of unbiased arbitration. The curators begin by reading the creative writing submissions of those who have picked Writer as their most preferred position (because writers tend to be the most competitive position). The curators decide who they believe should be writers and pair them accordingly. The rest of the positions can be filled as the curators see fit.
          * Anyone who signs up for the festival can join (there is no audition process), unless more people sign up than are able to participate due to sheer logistics. This participation cap is under curator discretion. If curators must turn people away or place them on a waitlist, they must prioritize including those who have never participated in the festival before, and exclude those who have been involved with Theater[24] many times.
          * There should be at least FOUR (4) plays in a festival and no more than SIX (6).
          * Every writer should have a partner. Under extenuating circumstances, writers may write in a trio.
          * Each play should have at least THREE (3) actors, unless there is no way to have a festival without a two-actor play.
          * Never should Theater[24] produce a one-person show.
          * If there is a shortage of participants, the position ‘Designer’ can be replaced by the curators. The curators may also step in for actors or directors. This should only be done under dire circumstances.

        As soon as arbitration is over, curators must send out emails alerting participants to their positions. These emails should include a link to an RSVP form, confirming their positions in the festival by that Thursday’s midnight. The emails should also tell participants when and where they need to be that weekend. (See Appendices 2.A, 2.B, 2.C, and 2.D.)

      * Friday 1 st week 6pm: Curators, writers, directors, designers, and actors meet in the FXK Theater to introduce themselves. The curators introduce the festival and the theme for the quarter. The actors then each give 60 second introductions on the stage, while writers and directors take notes. By 7pm, actors are dismissed.
      * After the actors are dismissed, the curators give the writers, designers, and directors a tour of the theater. This involves telling them the capabilities (and limitations) of the FXK tech equipment. The designers are dismissed.
      * Then, the curators match the writers with their directors. They give out the writing prompts to the writers and randomized cast lists. The writers and directors are free to discuss their initial ideas with each other, until 8pm. The directors are dismissed.
      * The curators and the writers go to BartMart to stock up on snacks for the night. They then go to that night’s writing location, where they meet the dramaturg. The curators go home, while the writers and dramaturg work until the next morning to write new plays!
          * During the night, the dramaturg should establish the festival’s show order.
          * Usually, the dramaturg will ask that the writers complete a first draft of their plays by midnight. However, it is the dramaturg’s choice as to how they want to structure the night.
          * The dramaturg should also act as a cursory sensitivity reader i.e. making sure no one writes an offensive play that might make directors/actors/designers feel unsafe/dehumanized.
      * At 7:45am, the final scripts are due to the Theater[24] email account. A curator prints scripts in Reynolds 001 using the UT copy code and brings them to the FXK.
      * At 8:15am, writers are brought to the FXK to meet with directors. They speak about their plays and artistic visions.
      * At 8:30am, actors and designers arrive. Curators take attendance and tell the festival participants which teams they are working in. Once the entire team for a play has arrived, they can start their readthroughs.
      * Once the readthroughs are over, writers are sent home to sleep.
      * Curators then schedule each play’s allotted rehearsal time in the FXK. Each play should have the opportunity to rehearse in the theater before tech.
      * Actors and directors are dismissed to go and rehearse wherever they please. Depending on how many designers there are, the curators will help design and program the shows’ light and sound cues.
      * At 4pm, tech begins. Tech will be run by the curators and will feature a Q2Q of each of the shows. At least ONE (1) member of Tech Staff should be clocked on and present to help with production.
      * After a break for dinner, writers, directors, and designers are called back into the theater for 7pm warmups.
      * At 7:30pm, house opens.
      * 8pm: the festival is performed! Curators introduce the festival and perform the fire speech.
      * When the shows have been performed, curators let the audience know of future University Theater shows that quarter.
      * After the audience has left, everyone involved in Theater[24] must help with Theater Cleaning!

  * ### Theater 24 and University Theater

    {:.ul-lower-alpha}
      * Upon the election of each new University Theater Committee, one of its members should be selected to be that Committee’s liaison for Theater[24]. This role includes:

        {:.ul-lower-roman}
          *  Being present for arbitration, meet-and-greet, the show, and cleanup. They should also be available throughout the day Saturday for tech and other needs upon curator request.
          *  Conflict resolution between participants of the festival.
          *  Organizing, running, and processing post-mortems of each festival.
          *  Spearheading the application process for Theater[24] curators. (See E: Curator Hiring Process)
  * ### Curator Responsibilities

    {:.ul-lower-alpha}
      * There should be at least FOUR (4) curators at each festival. If THREE (3) or fewer curators are able to participate in a particular quarter’s festival, a member or more of University Theater Committee should volunteer to support the remaining curators at that festival.
      * Curators should ensure that the festival runs smoothly according to the timeline exhibited in Section B.
      * If there are conflicts between participants of the festival, the curators should be the primary mode of contact, unless they choose to reach out to their Committee Liaison as per the CTS conflict resolution pathway.
      * If there are conflicts between the curators of the festival, the curators should reach out to their University Theater Committee Liaison for conflict resolution.
  * ### Curator Hiring Process

    {:.ul-lower-alpha}
      * Each winter quarter, before the Committee turnaround, University Theater Committee ought to reach out to the University Theater listhost to ask for applications to become a Theater[24] curator. All potential curators will fill out the application, experienced and new will fill out this application for the next year of Theater[24].

        {:.ul-lower-roman}
          * This application process should involve an interview with a member of University Theater Committee, ideally the Theater[24] liaison, and a curator of at least three previous Theater[24] shows for new curator applicants. Experienced curators will also re-interview for the position with the liason, but not with another curator.
          * Although the application process will be for the next three quarters (Spring, Fall, Winter), the applicant will be allowed to selectively apply for any/all of those next three quarters. This is so that applicants who wish to graduate/study abroad are still invited to curate as many festivals as they would like.
          * It is Committee’s responsibility to make sure that they accept at least FOUR (4) applicants for each of the next three quarters.
      * It is important that curators have some sort of training before they are launched into their first show in the whacky, stressful, exhilarating world of Theater[24].

        {:.ul-lower-roman}
          * This training should include at least ONE (1) festival credit shadowing the experienced curators of Theater[24]. This training can occur after/during the application process.
          * Cumulatively, team of curators should ideally have prior experience with stage/production management, sound design, and light design. This experience could be with University Theater or elsewhere.
          * That spring quarter, previous curators shall be invited back to help the new curators learn the ropes of curating the festival. Depending on how many new applicants there are (and the skillsets of those new applicants), UT Committee may invite more or fewer previous curators to help with the training process.
  * ### Amendments

    {:.ul-lower-alpha}
      * Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival may suggest amendments to these Bylaws, to be voted on by University Theater Committee and byother Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival.
      * University Theater Committee may also suggest amendments to these Bylaws, to be voted on by University Theater Committee and by other Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival.

## V. The University Theater Proposal Process
  * {:.clean-header} ### Mainstages, Second Stages, Studios and Collaborations
      1. #### Mainstages, Second Stages, and Studios
          * A proposer may email the Committee Chair to request a “preaison” from Committee. The preaison will meet with the proposer to discuss any questions the proposer might have about the proposal process.
          * Proposers meet with the Director of UT/TAPS and the TAPS Design Team to discuss their proposals. These individuals may recommend meeting with other members of the TAPS professional staff. Proposers meet with the Managing Director to discuss rights, if applicable.
          * Proposers present to a production cohort meeting. This meeting is open to all members of University Theater. In this meeting proposers discuss briefly their vision for their production,in terms of both design and process. After this meeting, attendees and proposers meet and form teams.
          * Proposers turn in their proposal by Friday of 3<sup>rd</sup> Week of the quarter prior to production by 5pm to the Committee Chair’s mailbox and electronically, either by fileshare (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. or emailed to [executivesessionuniversitytheatre@lists.uchicago.edu](mailto:executivesessionuniversitytheatre@lists.uchicago.edu)).

            {:.ul-upper-roman}
              * The Spring 10th week production may be proposed in the proposal cycle that occurs during Fall Quarter. If no production is passed in that slot at that time, the slot may be filled in the Winter Quarter proposal meeting as usual.
          * In the week following, proposers arrange time to meet with individual Committee members to discuss their proposal. Committee members are required to read all proposals and make themselves available for individual meetings.
          *   The proposal should include the following components:

              {:.ul-lower-roman}
                * Name and information about the proposer.
                * Cast size and Gender breakdown.

                * The production design aesthetic of the play and the textual justification for the aesthetic choice.
                * Bios for all staff members. These bios should include qualifications for the position as well as a statement about their particular area on the production.
                * While it is not required, inclusion rough drawings of set and costumes is suggested to strengthen the proposal.

              See Appendix 1.A for the Mainstage/Second Stage Proposal Form
          * The community-wide Mainstage Proposal Meeting is held 4<sup>th</sup> Week, usually at 5pm. No UT activity may be scheduled during the community-wide Proposal Meeting. Each proposer has one minute to present their proposal and five minutes to answer the questions of Committee and community members.
          * After all proposers have spoken, the Committee proceeds into the Executive (Closed) Session in an undisclosed location (See Section IV.A.3). Proposers who are also members of Committee are not allowed to sit in Executive Session Proposal Meeting or to vote on the season. If Director for the Dean's Men show is on Committee, however, they are permitted to take part in scheduling and vote on the season just as any other Committee member.

      2.  #### Collaborations
          RSOs may propose to collaborate with UT with the same deadline as mainstage proposals.
            * Proposing RSOs contact the Committee Chair expressing an interest in collaborating with UT. The RSO then sends a representative to a Committee meeting any time before the Mainstage proposal meeting to discuss the proposal with Committee.
            * Collaborations proposers are encouraged to meet with the Director of UT/TAPS and the TAPS Design Team to discuss their proposals. Proposers meet with the Managing Director to discuss rights, if applicable.
            * Proposers turn in their proposal by Friday of 3<sup>rd</sup> Week by 5pm to the Committee Chair's mailbox and electronically, either by fileshare (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. or emailed to [executivesessionuniversitytheatre@lists.uchicago.edu](mailto:executivesessionuniversitytheatre@lists.uchicago.edu)).
            * The proposal should include the following components:

              {:.ul-lower-roman}
                * Name and information about the RSO, and proposer, and their role in the organization.
                * A brief description of the Collaboration project.

At this meeting, as with the Mainstage proposers, the Collaboration proposers have one minute each to present their proposal and five minutes each to answer the questions of Committee and community members. Also as with Mainstage proposers, Collaboration proposers who are also members of Committee are not allowed to sit in the Executive Session Proposal Meeting or to vote on the season.
            * For the guidelines of the Collaboration process once a proposal passes, see Section IV.A.3.f.

      3. ### Mainstage Proposal Executive Session
          * Directly after the community-wide meeting, Committee goes into Executive Session to discuss each proposal individually. In this meeting, Committee considers whether a show:

            {:.ul-lower-roman}
              * Is appropriate to the proposer in terms of its scope and the proposer's relevant experience.
              * Identifies the proposer's focused goals for the production and communicates that the proposer has a clear and specific vision of the play.
              * Fits with University Theater's Mission Statement of Opportunity, Education, and Artistic Excellence.
              * Contains an appropriate staff, including Director, Stage Manager, and Design Team. (Filling the staff as best as possible by the proposal meeting is highly recommended.)
              * Is of feasible technical difficulty and requirements, given current University Theater equipment and personnel.
          *   #### Procedure and Policy for the Committee Proposal Meeting

              {:.ul-lower-roman}
                * The Proposal Meeting is run by the Director of UT/TAPS and the Committee Chair. If the Chair is proposing, the Treasurer runs the meeting. If the Treasurer is also proposing, the Secretary runs the meeting. If all three officers are proposing, another member of Committee will be selected at the prior Committee meeting by simple majority vote.
                * Committee does not vote for or against a proposal on a comparative basis. They base their vote solely on the proposal, and only weigh it in relation to other proposals when they vote on scheduling.
                * Committee takes a straw vote for each proposal. Any proposal receiving a unanimous 'yes' vote is automatically passed. Any proposal receiving a unanimous 'no' vote does not pass, and there is no further discussion about it.
                * All proposals that do not receive a unanimous yes or no from Committee are evaluated in the form of a list of pros and cons. Each Committee member presents at least one pro or one con in order to create these lists.
                * After ALL lists are made for each show being considered, the shows are discussed in greater detail and pro/cons are clarified if necessary.
                * Once discussion is completed, Committee votes on each proposal. In this vote, proposals pass if they receive a simple majority of votes. A proposal must have at least half the votes in the room to pass.




          *   #### Scheduling
              Once shows are passed, they are then scheduled. At times, shows can be passed but not scheduled due to limited resources. During scheduling, other productions (such as the Weekend(s) of Workshops, or New Work Week(s) in the Spring) are also scheduled. Once the season has been scheduled, Committee votes on the entire season as scheduled, requiring a simple majority to pass. Committee then reflects upon the season as a whole. Mainstages and Collaborations that are scheduled for the UT season are assigned Committee Liaisons. The Weekend(s) of Workshops, New Work Week, or other such productions are also assigned liaisons at this time. If there are multiple Weekends of Workshops, each one receives its own liaison.
          *   #### Calling Proposers
              After the season has been scheduled and reflected upon, Committee Liaisons will contact their respective proposers regarding the status of their proposal and its scheduling. The Committee member running the meeting contacts the proposers who shows were not scheduled. All Committee members must speak to their proposers by phone, _not_ via email or in person. The proposer must also be reached _directly_ by phone; voice mails are not permitted. Once all proposers have been reached directly by phone, the season may be announced by the Committee Chair via the UT general listhost.
          *   #### Post-Meeting Process: Mainstage
              Once scheduled, the staff of each Mainstage is encouraged to meet with UT/TAPS Pro-staff to continue to develop design plans, as well as to attend their respective cohorts. They will also be reminded that to be cast, all actors must audition.
          *   #### Post-Meeting Process: Collaborations
              Once scheduled, Collaborators meet with the Managing Director of UT/TAPS to look at venue choice and run capacity, calculate potential ticket sales, and calculate a budget. In the event that a Collaborator wishes to do a free event, the RSO must have money from their own account to cover any production expenses. After this budgeting process, the rest of the production timeline is the same as for Mainstages: the staff of each Collaboration is encouraged to meet with UT/TAPSPro-staff to continue to develop design plans, as well as to attend their respective cohorts.

  * {:.clean-header} ### Workshops

            See Appendix 1.B for the Workshops Proposal Form

        * The Workshops Proposal Meeting is held at the start of the 7<sup>th</sup> Week Committee Meeting, at 5pm. Each proposer has one minute to present their proposal and two minutes to answer the questions of Committee and community members.
        * After all proposers have spoken, they are excused and the Committee proceeds into the Executive (Closed) Session. Proposers who are also members of Committee are not allowed to sit in Executive Session Proposal Meeting or to vote on the Workshops. Once the Workshops have been voted on, proposers on Committee are permitted back into the room for the rest of the 7<sup>th</sup> Week Committee meeting, which proceeds as usual.
    3. #### Workshops Proposal Executive Session
        * Directly after the Workshops proposers have spoken, Committee goes into Executive Session to discuss each proposal individually. In this meeting, Committee considers whether a workshop:

          {:.ul-lower-roman}
            * Is appropriate to the proposer in terms of its scope and the proposer's relevant experience.
            * Identifies the proposer's focused goals for the production and communicates that the proposer has a clear and specific vision of the play.
            * Fits with University Theater's Mission Statement of Opportunity, Education, and Artistic Excellence.
            * Is of feasible technical difficulty and requirements, given the Workshops format and restrictions, as well as current University Theater equipment and personnel.
        * ##### Procedure and Policy for the Workshops Proposal Meeting

          {:.ul-lower-roman}
            * The Proposal Meeting is run by the Director of UT/TAPS and the Committee Chair. If the Chair is proposing, the Treasurer runs the meeting. If the Treasurer is also proposing, the Secretary runs the meeting. If all three officers are proposing, another member of Committee will be selected at the prior Committee meeting by simple majority vote.
            * While the driving question in the Mainstage Proposal meeting is, "Why pass this show?" the driving question in the Workshops Proposal meeting is, "Why not?" in the interest of opportunity. To that end, each proposal is discussed briefly, addressing any concerns with the proposal.
            * Progressing through each individual proposal in this way, Committee constructs a full lineup of Workshops.
            * Committee then votes on this line up. If discussion is still required and/or if Committee is still divided upon the season, they may move to pass Workshops individually until the lineup is complete and all Proposals have been addressed.
        * ##### Scheduling
            In the event that there are multiple Weekends of Workshops, Workshops that pass must be scheduled into one of the weekends. Once the Weekend(s) have been scheduled, Committee votes on the entire Workshops lineup as scheduled, requiring a simple majority to pass. Committee then reflects upon the Workshops lineup as a whole.
        * ##### Calling Proposers
            After the Workshops have been scheduled and reflected upon, the Committee Liaison(s) for Workshops will contact their various proposers regarding the status of their proposal and its scheduling. The Committee member running the meeting contacts the proposers whose shows were not scheduled. All Committee members must speak to their proposers by phone, _not_ via email or in person. The proposer must also be reached _directly_ by phone; voice mails are not permitted. Once all proposers have been reached directly by phone, the season may be announced by the Committee Chair via the UT general listhost.
        * ##### Post-Meeting Process
            Once scheduled, the Director and SM of each Workshop are encouraged to meet with UT/TAPS Pro-staff to continue to develop design plans, as well as to attend their respective cohorts.
  * {:.clean-header} ### Site-specific work
      1. #### Proposal process
          {:.ul-lower-alpha}
            * Individuals may propose site-specific work to be produced by UT for the following quarter any week before Eighth Week. Projects appropriate for Site-Specific production include pieces in spaces other than Theater West, Theater East, or the FXK.
            * Proposers must fill out the Site-Specific Proposal Form and submit it to the Committee Chair on Friday at 5PM before the meeting when the proposal is to be considered. The proposers must be present at the following committee meeting in order to answer questions about their proposal. The proposer has three minutes to present their proposal and as much time as necessary to answer the questions of Committee. The proposers are encouraged to meet with the TAPS Managing Director to discuss the production rights as well as the TAPS Production Manager to discuss the feasibility of locations cited.
            * The proposal should include the following components

              {:.ul-lower-roman}
                * Name and information about the proposer(s)
                * A brief description of the Site-Specific project.
                * Cast size and Gender breakdown.
                * Run time.
                * Spaces under consideration and how those spaces will be acquired.
                * The timeline that the proposer is considering
                * Any other resources desired from UT, including but not limited to student production staff, student performers, publicity, and audition space as well as technical needs (extension cords, scooplights, etc).

            * After the proposer has spoken, they are excused and the Committee proceeds into the Executive (Closed) Session. Proposers who are also members of Committee are not allowed to sit in Executive Session Proposal Meeting or to vote on Site-Specific Proposals. Once the proposal has been voted on, proposers on Committee are permitted back into the room for the rest of the meeting, which proceeds as usual.

            ## VI. The University Theater Production Process

            After a production is passed and scheduled by the University Theater Committee, it enters the Production Process. The following elements are not to be taken as the only necessary steps for producing with University Theater.

              * {:.clean-header} ### Pre-Production Quarter

                {:.ul-lower-alpha}
                  * Once the University Theater season is released, committee and the production teams will coordinate to ensure that only one lead design/management position is held by any given individual.
                  * Once production teams are finalized, they work with TAPS professional staff to fully realize design visions and determine budgets that are within the specified ranges.
                  * By the time of the Uber Production Meeting, production teams will finalize budgets. These budgets will be presented at the Uber Production Meeting, after which TAPS production staff and UT committee will determine exact final budgets.

                    {:.ul-lower-roman}
                      * The process for finalizing budgets will be as follows: TAPS professional staff will recommend to committee a budget for each production, after which committee, or a subcommittee appointed for this purpose, may pass these budgets by a majority vote. If a budget is not passed, committee or the appointed subcommittee will reenter discussions with TAPS professional staff, after which a new budget will be proposed. This continues until a final budget is passed for each production.
                          1. Any subcommittee created for this purpose must include the Treasurer of UT Committee and no less than three other members.
                      * If, after budgets for the spring quarter have been determined, UT committee decides that there is more money in the budget that can be spent on productions, that money may be added to the budget of the Spring 10th week production if that production was passed as described in V.A.1.D.I. This adjustment will be made in the same way as the original budget allocations.
                      * After this point, UT committee will issue no further financial support.
                  * All auditions will be scheduled at the same time in order to preserve the arbitration process.


              * {:.clean-header} ### Production Quarter

                {:.ul-lower-alpha}
                  * No Actor will be cast in multiple UT productions in any given season.
                  * There will be two days of auditions, usually Tuesday and Wednesday of 1st week.
                  * This will be followed by a day of callbacks, usually Thursday of 1st week.
                  * After callbacks, there will be pre-arbitration. In pre-arbitration, all directors and stage managers will meet to share ideal cast lists. After this the meeting will end without discussion of resolving conflicted castings.
                  * After this, there will be arbitration, presided over by a member of TAPS professional staff. Directors will meet with the professional staff member and discuss conflicts until no actors are cast in multiple productions. The presiding member of professional staff will have final say in resolving disputes.
                  * No fight or intimacy work will occur in UT that has not been approved by a professional choreographer. Any production that desires fight or intimacy work will work with TAPS professional staff to hire a professional fight or intimacy choreographer.
                  * A production’s committee liaison should make every human effort to be present for fight choreography rehearsals.
                  * Each show must elect a Cast Non-Equity Deputy and a Staff Non-Equity Deputy (Cast and Staff NED) by the end of the second production week, a process facilitated by the Committee Liaison in the absence of the director, stage manager, and production manager. If possible, these positions should be held by individuals who have participated in at least one previous University Theater production. The responsibilities of the Cast and Staff NEDs include the following:

                    {:.ul-lower-roman}
                      * Communicating and advocating on behalf of the cast and staff to the stage manager, production manager, and/or the Committee Liaison when their attention is brought to a conflict or concern that cannot be mediated between the complainants themselves. Unless anonymity is explicitly waived, the identities of the complainants must be anonymous.
                      * Meeting with the Committee Liaison at least once every two weeks to facilitate communication and bring up any concerns to the Committee Liaison.
                      * For the staff NED, making every human attempt to attend all scheduled production meetings.
