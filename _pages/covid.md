Proposals should plan for the following scenarios:

  <li>In-person performances with masking and/or socially distanced staging</li>
  <li>Virtual stream with some in-person work, plus adhere to any University and <a href="https://leadership.uchicago.edu/registered-student-organizations/autumn-quarter-2021-updates/">CLI COVID policies</a> at the time which could include masks, socially distanced staging, and limited or no audience</li>
</ol>

All University Theater-hosted events are open to invitees who are compliant with UChicago vaccination requirements, and because of ongoing health risks, particularly to the unvaccinated, participants are expected to adopt the risk mitigation measures (masking and social distancing, etc.) appropriate to their vaccination status as advised by public health officials or to their individual vulnerabilities as advised by a medical professional. Public convenings may not be safe for all and carries a risk for contracting COVID-19, particularly for those unvaccinated. Participants will not know the vaccination status of others and should follow appropriate risk mitigation measures.
