<em>Exploring classical emotions through pure dance.</em> Navarasa: Reimagined weaves passages from the English translation of Vincente Huidobro's epic poem Altazor with a set of unique soundtracks to depict the nine classical emotions known as Navarasa. With eight dance vignettes, Apsara explores the relationship between pure technique and storytelling movements that bring to life a deeply-rooted artistic tradition for contemporary audiences.</p> <p>
