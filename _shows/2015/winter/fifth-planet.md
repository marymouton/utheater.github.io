  <p>Gaze into the infinite with David Auburn's Fifth Planet, directed by Eleanor Clifford.  Two observatory workers meet and befriend each other while trying to pull personal significance and comfort from a vast and uncaring sky.  On the scale of the universe, loneliness seems inevitable, but maybe magic is inevitable, too.  In work and friendship, these characters seek to know anew, and knowledge depends on what the telescope can see.  Look up, this 6th week.</p><p>by <strong>David Auburn</strong><br/>
