description: 'This new play by contemporary Asian-American playwright Diane Oh centers
  on a writer, musician, and actor who confronts the Gr8 American Theater. Through
  ranting, laughing, singing, pleading, evoking history, making fun of, calling out,
  and deeply loving, our protagonist gives us a play-by-play critique of theatre –
  its diversity panels, fundraising galas, playbills, white leads, Shakespeare, and
  more. It is a fierce, joyful, relentless h8-filled love-fest that generously invites
  all of us to take a look at the institution to which we’re so devoted. (Video password:
