  Fall 2021'
description: "King Ferdinand of Navarre\u2019s \u201Cno fun\u201D edict mandates scholarly\
  \ endeavors, quiet contemplation and complete commitment to chastity for three entire\
  \ years. His closest courtiers reluctantly sign on. But in true comedic fashion\
  \ the arrival of the French Princess and her beautiful entourage quickly causes\
  \ the would-be scholars to realize that the whole endeavor was a bad idea, with\
  \ each votary trying to find a way to skirt the laws they themselves wrote. The\
  \ young men\u2019s studies soon give way to secret letters and amorous vows as the\
  \ women set out to teach the men a thing or two about love and commitment. The puns\
  \ fly and the playwright\u2019s wordplay take flight in this playful romantic comedy\
  \ about young love with a surprising conclusion where the characters' new outlooks\
  \ on life are tested. <br><div class=\"video-player-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/653270391?h=7d9911e5af&byline=0&portrait=0\"\
