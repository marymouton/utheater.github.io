  Spring 2021'
description: <em>Welcome Back to My Channel</em> is a virtual play that centers around
  the story of Martha, a popular makeup YouTube influencer. Struggling to stay relevant
  in the fast-paced world of social media, Martha begins to question her career as
  the relationships closest to her unravel and disintegrate. An honest look at modern
  definitions of loneliness, experience, and love, the play investigates a world in
  which the very concept of growing up has become commodified. <br><div class="video-player-wrapper"><iframe
