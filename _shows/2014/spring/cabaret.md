  <p><span>In this quarter's season closer, director Dani Wieder presents the 1987 revival of </span><em>Cabaret</em><span> (book by Joe Masteroff, music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb), a tangled web of romances set in Weimar Germany. This production returns to Christopher Isherwood's The Berlin Stories, a collection of gritty urban dramas and the original inspiration for the musical. Theater West becomes the Kit Kat Klub, a seedy basement stage full of music and lust. The lights are low, and the hopes are hot. And don't forget; war is on its way.</span></p><p><span>book by <strong>Joe Masteroff</strong><br/>
