  <span id="docs-internal-guid-eeb7dd0c-1342-193b-6152-b552168d34df"><span>UC Dancers’ winter showcase an annual dance production consists of around 10 dances, and runs about an hour. It is entirely student choreographed, with the exception of one dance every year that is professionally choreographed by a Chicago dance instructor. The dances range from duets to a piece performed by the entire UC Dancers’ company.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr">
  <span>The title and theme of this year’s show is “Voices.” It examines the way that we use expression. Each student choreographer is free to take the idea of expression and weave it into their piece how every they see fit. The variety styles and pacing of performances and the songs chosen to accompany each dance will show how individuals can bring their own voice to a single mode of expression. In line with this years “Voices” theme the performance this year will also include one dance set to acappella music performed live at the show by the UChicago Ransom Notes.</span></p><p><strong>“Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies—all these are private and, except <span>through symbols and secondhand, incommunicable.” —Aldous Huxley</span></strong><br/><span>Choreographer: Gabby Davis</span><br/><span>Music: “Aquarium” by Nosaj Thing</span><br/><span>Taylor Chamberlain, Samantha Chen, Chelsie Coren, Rachel Seebach</span></p><p><strong><span>“Sometimes saying nothing says the most.” —Emily Dickinson</span></strong><br/><span>Choreographer: Alexandra Berthiaume</span><br/><span>Music: “Nothing Left to Say” by Imagine Dragons</span><br/><span>Yujia Hu, Patrick O’Connor, Savannah Thais, Serina Wu</span></p><p><strong><span>“I hold it true whate’er befall; I feel it, when I sorrow most; ‘Tis better to have </span><span>loved and lost Than never to have loved at all.” — Alfred Lord Tennyson</span></strong><br/><span>Choreographer: Miranda Cherkas</span><br/><span>Music: “Hold On, We’re Going Home” by Drake, cover by Michelle Jones</span><br/><span>Lauren Clarke, Hilde Nelson, Frederica Rockwood, Ava Weiss</span></p><p><strong><span>“Rivers know this: there is no hurry.
