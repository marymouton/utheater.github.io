Due to COVID-19, our capacity to produce in-person shows and host in-person events may be limited in the 2021-22 academic year. Though guidelines are always evolving, UT and TAPS Pro Staff are committed to giving students access to the Logan resources they might require, both creatively and academically. Please direct questions about [in-person guidelines](https://ut.uchicago.edu/about/covid) and resources to UT Committee ([ut@uchicago.edu](mailto:ut@uchicago.edu)) and [TAPS Pro Staff](https://taps.uchicago.edu/people/staff).
