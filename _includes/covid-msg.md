Due to COVID-19, we are unable to produce in-person shows this quarter. And, as per University recommendation, we will also not be hosting any in-person events. Though guidelines are always evolving, UT and TAPS Pro Staff are committed to giving students access to the Logan resources they might require, both creatively and academically. Please direct questions about in-person guidelines and resources to Tiffany Trent ([ttrent@uchicago.edu](mailto:ttrent@uchicago.edu)), and questions about UTâ€™s online programming to Caitlyn Klum ([cklum@uchicago.edu](mailto:cklum@uchicago.edu)).
