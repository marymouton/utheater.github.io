This fall, directors probe into adaptations of well-known works to explore their voice in storytelling. The evening will feature Sophie Downes’ adaptation of “Dusk Before Fireworks” by Dorothy Parker and Abigail Hunter's “Selections from Dorian Gray” by Oscar Wilde.  A Weekend of Workshops commits each and every inhabitant of this intimate space to the expansion of the limits of their artistry.</span></span></p> <p class="clear" dir="ltr">
