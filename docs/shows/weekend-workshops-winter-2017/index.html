<span id="docs-internal-guid-ae54d66d-ff7a-ea69-edfd-638a736bde16"><span>Every quarter, </span><span>A Weekend of Workshops</span><span> allows directors to devise and stage big ideas on a small scale. This Winter’s workshops take well trodden tales and explore them from a new angle. </span><span><em>Pericles, but Marxist</em>,</span><span> directed by Coriander Mayer gives voice to the unnamed proletariat of Shakespeare’s late epic. </span><em><span>Selections from The Cherry Orchard</span></em><span>, directed by Rami Kablawi, explores the same scenes as comedy and tragedy. And </span><em><span>A World of His Own: a Twilight Zone Parody</span></em><span>, directed by Emma Heras, asks how does one deceive, or at least, surprise, a live audience.</span></span></p><p>
