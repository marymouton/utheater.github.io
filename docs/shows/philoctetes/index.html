Ten years have passed since Philoctetes, wielder of the bow of Heracles, was abandoned on an island as punishment. Now, in the midst of the Trojan war, Odysseus learns Philoctetes’ magical bow is the only hope in saving the Greeks and winning the war. In a quest for the bow, Sophocles’ epic tragedy asks if we are willing to sacrifice our morality for our country, and at what cost? </p><p>

<strong>Ling Lin</strong> (Assistant Director) is a first year TAPS/Econ major. She has worked on A Weekend of Workshops: <em>Love, Loss &amp; What I Wore</em> (Cast), <em>good friday</em> (Assistant Sound Designer), and <em>Fun Home</em> (Assistant Sound Designer).

<strong>Clarissa Mullig</strong> (Assistant Stage Manager) is a student in the college.</p><p>
<strong>Lia O’Bryan</strong> (Assistant Scenic Designer) is a second year Mathematics major. She has previously worked on <em>Grenadine</em> (Assistant Scenic/Puppet Designer), and she’s having a wonderful time working with such an incredible group!</p><p>
