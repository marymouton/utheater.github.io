Love's Labour's Lost<br/>
by William Shakespeare<br/>
directed by Maria Decker </p><p class="p1">
<span>The head and the heart aren’t too far apart in Love’s Labour’s Lost, written by William Shakespeare and directed by Maria Decker. Tangled up in the ivy league of the 1940s, four young scholars must choose between their ivory tower and the wits of four brilliant coeds. Together they employ pranks and poetry in pursuit of love, challenging an over-serious academy with humor and youth. As graduation looms, the students must decide what moments they’ll cherish and what follies they’ll leave behind.</span></p><p><strong>Sam Audette</strong> (Longaville) is a second-year majoring in Law, Letters, Society.
