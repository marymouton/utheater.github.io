directed by M.C. Steffen</p><p>
Young postgraduate bliss begins to shift into darker territory for newlyweds Abby and Zack, who are living as expats in the Belleville neighborhood of Paris. Zack’s days are nobly spent working to fight pediatric AIDS, but when Abby discovers him home alone one afternoon by surprise, lies that have been keeping the couple afloat begin to be revealed. Belleville morphs from a dark comedy about a dysfunctional relationship to a Hitchcockian thriller where “till death do you part” may be terrifyingly true.</p><p>
