    <p class="mt-3"><p>by Anton Chekhov, translation by Paul Schmidt<br/>
directed by Gwendolyn Wiegold</p><p>Written in 1895, The Seagull is Anton Chekhov’s famous tale of romantic woe and artistic identity. Considered to be the first of Chekhov’s four major plays, the story is an ensemble tale of an extended family in rural Russia grappling with themselves and each other in their quest for success and love. Famous for debuting as a critical failure, The Seagull today stands as one of Russia’s greatest theatrical works due to the beautiful richness of humanity in its characters that forces the audience to ask ourselves what gives us hope.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Michaela Voit </strong>(Arkádina) is a third-year in the College majoring in English and Public Policy.
