    <p class="mt-3"><p><span>It's the War of the Roses unlike ever before: within the confines of a classroom, schoolyard rules and storied rulers will be tested. Witness history conjured up—a chalkboard sketches the royal lineage and counts the dead, yardsticks stand for swords, paper airplanes and ink for arrows and blood, as the noble Houses of York and Lancaster renew their bitter struggle for the Crown of England. The text of Shakespeare will temper students and kings as they wonder: will chaos or convention reign at battle's end?</span></p> <p><strong>Bella Bagatelos</strong> (York) is a first year in the college, and this is her first UT/Dean's Men show.
