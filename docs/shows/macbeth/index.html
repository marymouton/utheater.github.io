    <p class="mt-3"><p>Dreams can contaminate the day and in Éamon Boylan's Macbeth, the wilds outside are something of a dream. Driven mad by the normative imperatives of a waking world, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth want self-fulfillment and happiness at any cost. Weird words affirm their ambition, and they decide to kill the normativity opressing them. A brutal mixture of Shakespearean verse and German Expressionist gesture and movement, Macbeth will murder sleep. Maybe yours.</p> <p>By <strong>William Shakespeare</strong><br/>
