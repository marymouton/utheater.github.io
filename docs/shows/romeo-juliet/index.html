by William Shakespeare<br/>
directed by Mariel Shlomchik</p> <p>
Two industrial powerhouses, the Capulets and the Montagues, grind through the competition in turn-of-the-century Pittsburgh. Amid ever expanding production and a gruesome family rivalry, two heirs of industry fall in love. But in the Dean’s Men outdoor rendition of Romeo and Juliet directed by Mariel Shlomchik, romance is no match for violence and greed in the grit of the city and even the smoggiest of skies can’t hide these lovers from their star-crossed fate. After all, blood may run thicker than water, but nothing makes the blood run like cold hard cash.</p><p>
