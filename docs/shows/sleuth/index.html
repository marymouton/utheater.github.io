The plot begins when Andrew Wyke, a successful mystery writer, lures his wife's lover, Milo Tindle, to his country home. Once there, the two engage in a game of cat and mouse with more twists and turns than the labyrinthian manor that surrounds them. Director MC Steffen invites you along for the ride, so long as you promise to inspect the uninspected.</span></span></p><p><span><span>by <strong>Anthony Shaffer</strong><br/>
