Birthdays are an ideal moment to look back on the past and ruminate on what went wrong. On his 69th birthday, an aging and so far unsuccessful writer indulges in an annual ritual of reflection in Samuel Beckett’s <em>Krapp’s Last Tape</em>, directed by Jonathan Sorce. But in confronting his former selves, he must also confront his past full of missed opportunities for happiness, traded for the sake of his work. When the best days of life have already passed and the sum of all those years is nothing more than regret, from bananas to red wine— it all tastes like loneliness.</p> <p dir="ltr">
