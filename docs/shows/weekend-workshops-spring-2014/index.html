<span class="small_text_a">Every quarter,<em> A Weekend of Workshops</em> allows directors to devise and stage big ideas on a small scale. This spring, truth, or a lack thereof, is a matter of perspective. Victorian era British gentility learns that its house may be on fire, literally. Poetry, sound, and movement create the dissonance that may or may not be human nature. And the first lady of Argentina may sing a different song than we expect. Alex Hearn directs <em>The Still Alarm</em> by George Kaufman, Derek Spencer stages Harmony Korine's <em>A Crackup at the Race Riots</em>, and Allie Garfinkle presents <em>A Little Star Quality: Scenes from Evita</em>.</span></p><p>
